use radiks and next.js

webassembly - you can write in other languages
- write code in that langauge them export it to webassembly
- get safety measures from your language like go or rust then export to webassembly

Blockstack is building their own language - and its not turing complete 
- Launching smart contract support in the fall 
- Test network sometime soon in the SVGAnimatedEnumeration
- SCs with current blockstack 
- DApps are not necessarily in need of SCs 
- can build network apps without SCs 
- what's more important is that user profiles are decentralized and private
- protect user Data - SCs comes with a high cost and impedes UX
- DocuSign DApp - can always do that with any 

Blockstack is built ontop of Bitcoin 
- blockstack ID is made and saved using bitcoin blockchain 
- build something sikmilar?
    
    - saving metadata in a transaction, build SC ontop of it - using 
    - if you need a dapp to work with a SC on Ethereum you can work with it while
    - still working on SCs
    
    - With bitcoin you only work with metadata as an alternative to SCs
    - Cosmos allows interchain transactions 

    - Core logic and fundamentals

    - Get into contact with Shannon
      - host routine meetups with theme 
      - DAppss aroudn decentralized apps
      - what are the values to create around decentralized apps 

      DApp interchain communication:
      -  Lets a DApp talk to SCs on another blockchain, such as Ethereum, 
	 when the DApp is hosted, or originally built on a different blockchain
	 - E.g.  DApp built on Bitcoin's blockchain and can interact
	 - 	 with SCs on Ethereum blockchain, interaction 
  	 - 	 behaviour would serve to add features/benefits from 
 	 - 	 one blockchain that are not natively offered from 
 	 - 	 the host, or infrastructure, blockchain. 
	 - The benefit of these interchain comms would add greater
  	 - flexibility for DApp developers and minimize risk of 
	 - having to switch DApp codebase to another blockchain.
